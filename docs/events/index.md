### Events
Vue-form-wizard emits certain events when certain actions happen inside the component. The events can be noticed in some of the demos and especially in the [async validation demo](https://jsfiddle.net/bt5dhqtf/272/)
* **on-complete** Called when the finish button is clicked and the `before-change` for the last step (if present) was executed. No params are sent together with this event. `this.$emit('on-complete')`
* **on-loading** Called whenever an async `before-change` is executed. This event is emitted before executing `before-change` and after finishing execution of `before-change` method. `on-loading` is emitted together with a Boolean value. `this.$emit('on-loading', value)`
* **on-validate** Called whenever the execution of a `before-change` method is completed. The event sends along a Boolean which represents the validation result as well as an int with te tab index. `this.$emit('on-validate', validationResult, this.activeTabIndex)`
* **on-error** Called when `before-change` is a promised and is rejected with a message. The message is passed along `this.$emit('on-error', error)` See async validation fiddle
* **on-change**  Called upon step changes. Has prevIndex and nextIndes as params. `this.$emit('on-change', prevIndex, nextIndex)`
